Improvised caesar dressing for a kale salad. (B: Based on Kenji's Serious Eats
recipe, but really I thought this was better.)

* half a can of anchovies (the flat kind) with their oil
* 4 smashed garlic cloves
* eyeballed ~2-4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (enough to cover the entire
  bottom of the food processor bowl)
* 1 egg yolk


blend (food processor)

drizzle grapeseed oil in until it looks like dressing

kale salad this evening was torn lacinato leaves, massaged with olive oil and
salt and left to rest.

julienned raw beets in bariani balsamic vinegar toasted bread crumbs

combine, cover with parmesan
