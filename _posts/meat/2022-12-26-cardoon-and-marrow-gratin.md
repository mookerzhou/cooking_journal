Cardoons are gorgeous perennials that grow really well in the Bay Area and are
delicious when prepared correctly. They taste _a lot_ like artichoke hearts but
have a lot more edible product per plant and just way less fussy to eat. The
Weird Catch is that you can't really buy them anywhere.

This recipe is a somewhat complicated French casserole dish we made using
[cardoons][cardoons] grown at home. We pieced together this recipe and approach
from a few [different][bittman] [sources][egullet] online. The quantities here
aren't precise and we basically used as much to fill a smaller, enameled
casserole dish.

* Prepare the cardoons:
  - If growing at home, you'll need to bundle the cardoon fronds together with
    some burlap and leave in the garden for a few weeks before you eat
    them. Confusingly, this is called ['blanching'][blanch1] and is intended to
    sweeten the cardoons, which are generally very bitter. (Aside: it's unclear
    if this is [necessary][blanch2].)
  - Harvest cardoons, strip leaves, wash thoroughly, and remove any stringy
    fibers. Cut into 3 inch battons and store under some lemon water until
    finished.
  - Blanch in salty, boiling water until edible/al dente, and remove.
* Prepare the bone marrow:
  - Return the blanching pot to a boil and add bone marrow (whole, bones and
    all) to the pot for just a minute or two.
  - Remove bone marrow and set on ends in casserole dish.
* Prepare a sauce:
  - Melt 2 tbsp or so of shallot compound butter in a pan. Once melted, add 2
    tbsp of flour and stir to lightly cook. Add salt as needed and ground black
    pepper.
  - Add about 1/2 quart of chicken stock and reduce to a sauce over 30 minutes.
* Layer cardoon battons in-between the marrow bones in the casserole dish,
  following with sauce. Cover top layer with grated hard cheese.
* Bake at 350F until top layer is browned and bubbly.

Supposedly we sauteed mushrooms in white wine and butter and added them,
possibly as a final layer before the cheese.
