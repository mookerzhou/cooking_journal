Adapted from "Salad Samurai"'s That 70s Tofu recipe. Tastes like you got it at a hot bar at a hippie food co-op. I brought this to a potluck and it was surprisingly a hit with the 1 year old. We've been making it a lot this year since it's a low effort dish that is easy to make if you're home all the time with a new born, say. 

Ingredients
* 1 pack firm tofu
* 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (I eyeball)
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce (for Authenticity, use Braggs aminos, but I don't keep that around)
* 1 tablespoon granulated dried garlic
* 1 tablespoon "white people dried green herbs" of some kind -- oregano, basil.
* 4 tablespoons chili powder. You don't want like, spicy good chili powder here. You want the back of the shelf, found it at an Airbnb, somebody once used this to make some beef chili vibes. If you don't have that, sub paprika.
* 2 tablespoons olive oil

Technique
* Dice tofu. (Cut it down the middle like you're opening a book, cut it 4-5x in both of the other axes)
* Add all ingredients, stir. There should be some liquid pooling at the bottom. If not, add some more soy sauce / acv. 
* Marinate on the counter for at least 1 hour, stirring everytime you pass the bowl, at least 3-4x. Or shove it in the fridge and stir it in a few times in the next day or two.
* Place on a baking sheet in a toaster oven at 400F. Bake until liquid is almost entirely evaporated, stir so that all of the tofu gets coated by the sauce.
* Serve hot, warm, or cold.
