We made and canned this jam in May, which is just about the height of [Bay Area
jam season][bay_area_jam]. It's a *relatively* low-sugar jam using a full tray
of strawberries (6 ventilated pint containers, about ~4.5 lbs) and [Pomona's
pectin][pectin].

* 'Hull' strawberries. That is: using a paring knife remove the green, leafy
  top and the pale white flesh immediately underneath.
* Add strawberries to a *non-reactive* pot, heat gently and then mash.
* Add to pot and stir until incorporated:
  - 2 cups sugar
  - 4 tsp Pomona's pectin
  - 4 tsp Calcium water (prepped from Pomona's pectin instructions)
* Bring to a full rolling boil and then add:
  - vinegar (we used about 1/3 cup of sherry vinegar)
  - salt (to taste, 1 teaspoon)
* Cook at high heat until frothing subsides and the top is glossy, about 10
  minutes.
* Check that the jam has 'set' by cooling some on a plate. It shouldn't move
  much when cooled.

Notes:

- You can vary the amount and type of sugar, salt, and acid to your own
  preference.
- If canning, this amount fills about up about 4-5 pint Ball jars.
