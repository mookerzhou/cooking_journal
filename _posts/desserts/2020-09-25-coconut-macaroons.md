Adapted from the recipe from Black Jet Baking provided to the [WSJ](https://www.facebook.com/notes/black-jet-baking-co/the-recipe-as-seen-in-the-wsj/384669008222057/)

### Ingredients:
* 9 oz (about 3 cups) unsweetened large-flaked coconut (aka chips)
* 9 oz (about 4 1/4 cups) unsweetened desiccated coconut
* 3 sticks unsalted butter
* 1 lb (about 2 cups) granulated sugar
* 6 eggs
* 2 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1 tablespoon  vanilla extract (optional)

### Directions
* In a bowl, thoroughly combine both types of coconut.
* Combine butter and sugar over medium-high heat in a heavy-bottomed 4 quart pan. Bring the mixture to a medium amber caramel, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon so that the mixture does not burn, 20-30 minutes. When it has achieved desired color, stir in salt and vanilla extract. Add half of the coconut mixture to the caramel and stir to incorporate. Remove the caramel-coconut combo from stove and let sit 5 minutes.
* In a large bowl, whisk eggs and fold in the other half of the coconut mixture.
* Working rapidly, stir the coconut and egg mixture into the caramel-coconut combo with a wooden spoon. It is imperative that you move quickly so that you do not cook the eggs.
* Stirring constantly return pot to medium heat until the mixture comes together, about 15 minutes.  The result should be thick and medium-brown.
* Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Completely cool the mixture in the refrigerator, then use an ice cream scoop to place the unbaked macaroons on a parchment-lined sheet pan.  Bake until the cookies are a dark golden brown, 15-30 minutes. Let cool before serving.
