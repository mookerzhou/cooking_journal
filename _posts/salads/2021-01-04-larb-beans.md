Inspired by Kin Khao's Nam Tok beans. Never got the texture/seasoning to taste quite as crispy, so let's just call these larb beans shall we? Very tasty, very savory, we've been making them regularly and they never last long.

Ingredients:
* Cooked beans, a few cups cooked. Hearty beans with a thicker skin work best. Scarlet runner beans are great. Cranberry beans might work but are a little soft. 
* 1-2 shallots, thinly sliced
* 1-2 cloves of garlic, minced
* Fish sauce
* Rice, 1-2 cups
* Oil
* Dried pepper flakes (ancho/ghost/whatever)
* 2-4 limes
* 1/2 cup chopped mint
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
* Optional: chopped chives, green onions, chopped hot peppers, chopped pickled carrots/onions

Technique:
* Toast rice in a wok/cast iron pan by placing rice in the hot pan, dry, with no oil and stirring constantly over medium-high heat until evenly golden brown. This step can take 15-20 minutes, beware.
* After toasted, grind in a blade grinder and set aside. The rice powder will last indefinitely in a closed container in the cabinet, and you can make it ahead of time or in smaller batches.
* Brown sliced shallots and garlic in oil in the pan.
* Add cooked beans and 2-3 tablespoons fish sauce and dried pepper flakes.
* Add 1/2 cup toasted rice powder and stir until incorporated. Cook over low-medium heat for a few minutes, stirring constantly until the rice powder and fish sauce are well absorbed and incorporated.
* Remove from heat and pan (removing from pan is important as cast iron/woks react to acid) and add squeezed lime and fresh chopped herbs/pickles as you choose to use them.
* Taste for salt/spice/acid, and add more to taste, as well as more rice powder. Stir.
* Eat on lettuce leaves / chard leaves or on rice.
