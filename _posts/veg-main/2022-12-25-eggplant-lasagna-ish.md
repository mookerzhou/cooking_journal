This is a casual summer/early Fall casserole to use up tomatoes, eggplants, and
basil from the CSA or garden. Not really a lasagna, as it doesn't use lasagna
noodles.

- Slice Italian-style eggplant thinly, salt, and spread out on a sheet pan to
  expel some water.
- Dry off eggplant with a towel, bake on sheet pan in the oven at 350F until
  cooked through.
- In a casserole dish, interleave eggplant with tomato sauce and grated
  pecorino, parmesan, etc.
  * Lightly oil panko breadcrumbs with olive oil in large bowl.
  * Complete the last layer with tomato sauce, grated cheese, and oiled panko
    breadcrumbs (in that order).
  * Heat through in the oven at 350F.
- Sprinkle with fresh basil, either chopped or whole.
