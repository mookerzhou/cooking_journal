Oh no! It's been almost two years and we haven't written a new single recipe
here.

...Anyway! This is a sticky mustard-based BBQ sauce for pulled pork we made
early in 2022. The final product should fill a 8oz deli container.

Add the following to a non-reactive sauce pan, heat to a simmer and cook until
slightly reduced and syrupy.

- 1/3 cup apple cider, or shallot vinegar (if available)
- 1/3 cup yellow mustard
- 1/4 cup ketchup
- 2 tsp fish sauce
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp fine mustard powder
- 1/2 tsp [mitmita][mitmita], or some other finely ground chili powder blend
- 1 tbsp (?) brown sugar
- 1 tbsp (?) honey
- additional salt, if needed
