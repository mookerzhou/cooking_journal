This is a replica of a Market Hall salad that can just be made with containers
of things from Berkeley Bowl. This version is significantly cheaper than a trip
to Rockridge.

In a giant metal bowl, mix:

* Two bunches of dino kale, washed, shredded, and then massaged with olive oil
* 2 cups of green lentils cooked with bay leaves
* Cup or so roasted, unsalted almonds, roughly chopped
* One square of sheep feta, chopped
* One half-quart container of Castelvetrano olives, roughly chopped
* (Optional) Two small avocados, diced

Add olive oil, sherry or red vinegar, and salt to taste.
