Writing this up so that Buro can make it too. <3

Ingredients

* 1 pound ground pork
* 1/2 cup - 1 cup white jasmine/sticky rice
* 1-2 limes
* fish sauce
* few tablespoons grapeseed oil
* 5-6 dried arbol chilis (optional)
* 2-3 fresh thai chilis, sliced (optional)
* 1 finely sliced shallot (optional)
* 1/2 bunch green onions, chopped (optional)
* 1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped (optional)
* few sprigs mint, chopped (optional) 
* lettuce / chard leaves for serving (optional)

Tools

* 1 wok / cast iron pan
* 1 blade grinder

Technique

* In dry pan, toast rice until all grains are evenly light brown. Stir frequently over medium heat.
* Remove rice from pan, grind coarsely in blade grinder. If you have one, you can use a granite mortar & pestle instead. Set aside ground rice. 
* If using chili, toast in the dry pan. Grind finely in blade grinder. Set aside. 
* If using shallot, heat up oil in the same pan, and add shallots. Cook until sweated through and lightly browned. Add salt at the beginning to speed time to sweat. 
* If using fresh thai chilis and dried arbol chilis, add now. 
* Add ground pork. Cook until cooked through, but still juicy.
* Add fish sauce to taste. Turn heat off. Add chopped herbs and rice powder. You can add the rice powder a little at a time and taste as you go.
* Remove larb from the pan, as both wok/cast iron are acid reactive. Juice limes into larb. Taste and add more fish sauce if needed. 
* Eat as a lettuce wrap or on top of rice, as you wish.
