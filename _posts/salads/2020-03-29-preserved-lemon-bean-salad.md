My friend Stumm was encouraging me to write up more food posts, so here's one for him, a fellow Rancho Gordo bean fan. 

Ingredients:
* 1 pound Rancho Gordo (or other) dried scarlet runner beans. You can substitute other beans here, but you're looking for something meaty and substantial.
* two or three preserved lemons and some preserved lemon juice. Preserved lemons are super easy to make at home, so if you're reading this in winter, I encourage you to try! They last for years in the fridge.
* olive oil 
* salt
* celery (optional) 

Steps:
* Cook the beans. An instant pot is fine for this application, add a glug of olive oil to the cooking broth, but do not salt. You want the beans to not be falling apart and still be sort of firm, as this is a salad.
* Chop up the preserved lemon into small 1cm x 1cm dice
* Dice celery into similar sized dice, if using.
* After beans are room temperature or cooler, mix all ingredients. Add extra preserved lemon juice and olive oil and salt to taste. 

Salad is super savory and stores well and tastes even better the next day and the next.

P.S. and I know it's not the usual in these blog posts, but here's an image of our scarlet runner bean plant from last summer:
